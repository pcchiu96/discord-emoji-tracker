# Overview

A discord emoji tracker that my discord group used weekly to find the popularity of each custom emoji (including reactions to messages).

# Commands

-   prefix emojis : gets all the emojis usage in the current channel for the past 10k messages.
-   prefix emojis -a : gets all the emojis in every channel.
-   prefix emojis -[number] : emojis from "number" days ago.
-   prefix emojis -[emoji(s)] : only track the specific "emoji(s)".

# Examples

-   prefix emojis -a -7 : will get all the custom emojis in every channel in the past 7 days.
