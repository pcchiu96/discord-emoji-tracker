# Overview

A discord emoji tracker that my discord group used weekly to find the popularity of each custom emoji (including reactions to messages).

# Commands

-   prefix emojis : gets all the emojis usage in the current channel exactly one day ago.
-   prefix emojis -a : changes the search location to all visible channels to the bot.
-   prefix emojis -[number] : get emojis from [number] days ago.
-   prefix emojis -[emojis] : only track the specific [emojis].

# Examples

-   prefix emojis -a -7 : will get all the custom emojis in every channel in the past 7 days.
